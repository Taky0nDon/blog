    <p>Appolonian and Dionysiac tendencies form a: dialectic, tension, harmony,
synthesis. Multiplicity of being. Apollo is rational man--hypnotized by
illusion (shadows on the cave wall). Dionysus is primal will.</p>

    <p>The Dionysiac element that most resonates with me is the Heirocletian flux.
The ineffable interchange, the Brownian motion of being, the stormy sea
which must sink any ship of meaning haughty enough to attempt the journey.
In order to avoid disaster, it is necessary for the vessel to be girded by
Myth.
</p>
    <p>It seems I have over indexed into Apollonian being. Perhaps that is why I
find the Dionysiac so romantic and appealing. The surgering waters of that
inhospitable sea fill me as they drag me down, away from the light and into
the abyss.
</p>
    <p>To apprehend Dionysiac being is to be both absolutely free, and completely
paralyzed. No action can be justified, nor inaction repudiated, in that
primordial maelstrom where possibility becomes so pervasive it renders
itself meaningless. The lack of order, the impermanence that invalidates
time (for there is no relative constancy with which to identify a moment),
necessarily reduces agentic being to pure chance or cold determinism. That
preternatural flux leaves no room for conscious action. In the presence of
such a powerfull Will, there can be no other.
