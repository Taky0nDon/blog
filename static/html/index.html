                            <p>Appolonian and Dionysiac tendencies form a: dialectic, tension, harmony,
                        synthesis. Multiplicity of being. Apollo is rational man--hypnotized by
                        illusion (shadows on the cave wall). Dionysus is primal will.</p>

                            <p>The Dionysiac element that most resonates with me is the Heirocletian flux.
                        The ineffable interchange, the Brownian motion of being, the stormy sea
                        which must sink any ship of meaning haughty enough to attempt the journey.
                        In order to avoid disaster, it is necessary for the vessel to be girded by
                        Myth.
                        </p>
                            <p>It seems I have over indexed into Apollonian being. Perhaps that is why I
                        find the Dionysiac so romantic and appealing. The surgering waters of that
                        inhospitable sea fill me as they drag me down, away from the light and into
                        the abyss.
                        </p>
                            <p>To apprehend Dionysiac being is to be both absolutely free, and completely
                        paralyzed. No action can be justified, nor inaction repudiated, in that
                        primordial maelstrom where possibility becomes so pervasive it renders
                        itself meaningless. The lack of order, the impermanence that invalidates
                        time (for there is no relative constancy with which to identify a moment),
                        necessarily reduces agentic being to pure chance or cold determinism. That
                        preternatural flux leaves no room for conscious action. In the presence of
                        such a powerfull Will, there can be no other.
