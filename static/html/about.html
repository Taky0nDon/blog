                <p>Hi, my name's Mike, and I made this blog to learn more about
                hosting a website. I wanted to be responsible for as many of
                the details as possible. Previously, I'd built a blog running
                on Flask and deployed on Render, but it was entirely too much
                magic for me! Especially the way Render would automatically
                redeploy every time I made a new commit to my Github. I felt
                like a lot of interesting stuff was being hidden from me! This
                blog is my way of exploring that interesting stuff.
                <p>
