<h2 class="blog-post-tile">My Blog's Story of Becoming What It Is</h2>
<article>

    <p> The idea to host my own blog came from a project I did for the Udemy
    course <i>100 Days of Code</i> by Angela Yu. We built a blog out of Flask
    and Bootstrap. It was a fun exercise and I learned alot, especially about
    server side rendering and ORMs. </p>

    <p> Since then I have endeavored to try to dive a little bit deeper by not
    allowing myself the luxury of using a prebuilt framework like Flask. I also
    resolved not to rely on a service like Render to handle all the hosting and
    deployment for me. I had the crazy notion of getting a bare bones VPS and
    getting to to serve a website with nothing but my terminal and a dream.
    </p>

    <p> After choosing the right plan, I immediately went about adding a SSH
    key so I wouldn't have to log in with a password. Feeling pretty good about
    myself just then, I was horrified to find that I'd forgotten the pass
    phrase for that key, so I was unable to access the terminal on the server
    except through the browser and DigitalOcean's website. I don't know about
    you, but I didn't learn how to use the terminal so I could do it in a
    browser! This simply would not do. </p>

    <p> After about 2 hours of trying to add and remove keys through the
    DigitalOcean website, manually editing the `authorized_keys` file, and
    destroying and rebuilding the droplet, I finally managed to get it set up
    right so I could connect from my terminal. </p>

    <p> The next step was to create a new user account, one that wasn't root
    but had sudo privileges so I could use it to maintain the server. This  is
    a common practice to decrease the chances of unauthorized access to the
    root user, which would grant complete control of the VPS. This was simple
    enough, although I once again ran into some issues regarding password
    authentication and had to delete and recreate the user. </p>

    <p> Having dispensed with basic preparation, I started the fun part. I
    wanted to host a blog, and to do that I was going to have to expose HTML
    files to the internet, at the very least. In order to test this out, I used
    a nifty Python module called `http.server`. With one recital of the
    incantation: `py -m http.server`, I was able to somewhat alarmingly view
    the contents of my home folder from the browser. I also got a bit of
    practice with firewall-cmd in order to make this work. </p>

    <p> I had proved that it was possible for me to render HTML from my server
    to anyone on the internet. Hooray! The next step was to find a more robust
    solution than to leave my Python process running. Honestly, I probably
    would have stuck with that, if they hadn't been so emphatic that it was
    <b>not</b> a production-ready solution. Okay, fine. So what to do now? I
    did a little bit of research on simple HTTP servers and decided to go with
    Nginx. I found it very well documented and got it set up in a matter of
    minutes. <p>

    <p> So, what's next? Well, the site is still pretty ugly, so I need to make
    it at least a little bit more presentable. I also want to go with some sort
    of psuedo-SPA design, where clicking links to different blog posts will
    only alter one aspect of the DOM and not trigger a full page reload. In
    order to accomplish this, I am going to create a database (probably using
    SQLite because I'm familiar with it, and I think it will more than suit my
    purposes). Then I will use a little JavaScript to hit the database and
    change the content of the DOM element hosting the article when it is
    clicked. </p>

    <p> Sounds simple enough, right? Stay tuned for my follow up post exploring
    the unforeseen obstacles I expect to encounter on this path. </p>
